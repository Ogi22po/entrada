Entrada uses GitHub to manage reviews of pull requests.

* If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a pull
  request.

* If you plan to do something more involved, please first discuss your ideas
  on our [mailing list](https://mailman.sidn.nl/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/entrada-dev).
  This will avoid unnecessary work and surely give you and us a good deal
  of inspiration.
