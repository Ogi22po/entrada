This directory contains original ENTRADA scripts which have been modified to
work in AWS Elastic MapReduce using Hive instead of Impala.

If you wish to use these, start a cluster through the console, make sure it has
hive and uses AWS Glue as its metastore. If you do encounter errors, please
submit them on github.
